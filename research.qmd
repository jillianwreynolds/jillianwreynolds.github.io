I am currently researching affective polarization, civic duty, and voter turnout. The literature is inconclusive regarding a  (clear) relationship between affective polarization and turnout. I theorize that civic duty may help explain the relationship by acting as a mediator.

My research interests include:

-   Affective polarization, also ideological and geographic polarization

-   Public opinion

-   Political behavior

-   State comparative politics

-   California politics
