I am currently researching affective polarization, civic duty, and voter turnout. The literature is inconclusive regarding a (clear) relationship between affective polarization and turnout. Studies of multiparty systems found an association, but studies in the U.S. have not. Separate research has shown that a sense of civic duty can increase someone's chances of voting. I theorize that civic duty may help explain an association between affective polarization and turnout by acting as a moderator. This is represented by the dashed line in @fig-theory; the solid lines indicate what existing literature has studied.

My next research project is my MA thesis, which will look at affective polarization, civic duty, (preference for) straight/split ticket voting, and vote choice.

My research interests include:

-   Affective polarization, also ideological and geographic polarization

-   Public opinion

-   Political behavior

-   State comparative politics

-   California state and local politics
